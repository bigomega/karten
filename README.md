# karten
A framework for building fantasy card games

## Possible card universes
  - Dota
  - Harry potter
  - Smite (or let's say, Gods)
  - Marvel universe
  - DC universe
  - Game of thrones
  - Pokemon

##
  - Step 1: Simulate Hearthstone ([Work log](work_log.md))
  - Step 2: Finish Step 1

### Notes
> What if there's just 1 game with all types of cards in it, then there'll be this umbrella of universe and house.
> There'll be buff's/debuff's/spells specific to universe or house or minion type.
> There could also be some player spells if the deck is full of a same house. < Gotta rethink.
